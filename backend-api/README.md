# API Documentation

This document provides a brief overview of the API, its endpoints, authentication, and authorization mechanisms.

## Authentication

To access protected endpoints, you need to obtain a JSON Web Token (JWT) by sending a `POST` request to the `/auth/signin` endpoint with a user's email and password.

**Request:**
```http
POST /auth/signin
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "accessToken": "your_jwt_token"
}
```

You must include this `accessToken` in the `Authorization` header for all subsequent requests to protected endpoints, using the `Bearer` scheme:

`Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token`

## Roles and Permissions

The API uses a role-based access control system to protect its endpoints. There are three roles available:

-   `ADMIN`: Has full access to all resources, including user and task management.
-   `LEADER`: Can manage their own tasks and view all tasks.
-   `USER`: Can only view tasks.

## Endpoints

### Users (`/users`)

User management is restricted to users with the `ADMIN` role.

-   **`GET /users/:id`**: Retrieves the details of a specific user.
-   **`POST /users`**: Creates a new user. The `role` can be specified in the request body (`ADMIN`, `LEADER`, `USER`).
-   **`PATCH /users/:id`**: Updates the details of a specific user.
-   **`DELETE /users/:id`**: Deletes a specific user.
-   **`POST /users/upload`**: Uploads an avatar for a user.

### Tasks (`/tasks`)

-   **`GET /tasks/All`**: Retrieves a list of all tasks. Accessible to all authenticated users.
-   **`GET /tasks/:id`**: Retrieves a specific task by its ID. Accessible to all authenticated users.
-   **`POST /tasks`**: Creates a new task. Accessible to `ADMIN` and `LEADER` roles.
-   **`PATCH /tasks/:id`**: Updates a task.
    -   `ADMIN`: Can update any task.
    -   `LEADER`: Can only update their own tasks.
-   **`DELETE /tasks/:id`**: Deletes a task.
    -   `ADMIN`: Can delete any task.
    -   `LEADER`: Can only delete their own tasks.
